The capital of France is Paris. Known as the "City of Light" (La Ville Lumi√®re), Paris is not only the political center of the country but also a major hub for art, fashion, gastronomy, and culture. Its rich history and numerous landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre Museum, make it one of the most visited cities in the world. Paris has played a significant role in European history and has been at the heart of events like the French Revolution and various cultural and intellectual movements.
